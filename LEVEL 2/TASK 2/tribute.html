          <h1>TESLA</h1>
          <p>
            The company was incorporated as Tesla Motors, Inc. on July 1, 2003,
            by Martin Eberhard and Marc. Elon Musk took an active role within
            the company and oversaw Roadster product design at a detailed level,
            but was not deeply involved in day-to-day business operations. In
            May 2010, Tesla purchased what would later become the Tesla Factory
            in Fremont, California, from Toyota for $42 million,[34] and opened
            the facility in October 2010. In November 2016, Tesla acquired
            SolarCity, in an all-stock $2.6 billion deal, and entered the
            photovoltaics market. Tesla opened its first "Gigafactory" outside
            the United States in Shanghai, China, in 2019. Giga Shanghai was the
            first automobile factory in China fully owned by a foreign company.

            Space Exploration Technologies Corp. (SpaceX) is an American
            spacecraft manufacturer, launcher, and a satellite communications
            corporation headquartered in Hawthorne, California. It was founded
            in 2002 by Elon Musk with the stated goal of reducing space
            transportation costs to enable the colonization of Mars. The company
            manufactures the Falcon 9, Falcon Heavy, and Starship launch
            vehicles, several rocket engines, Cargo Dragon and Crew Dragon
            spacecraft, and Starlink communications satellites. In January 2019
            SpaceX announced it would lay off 10% of its workforce to help
            finance the Starship and Starlink projects.[82] Construction of
            initial prototypes and tests for Starship started in early 2019 in
            Florida and Texas.

          <h1>NEURALINK</h1>
          <p>
            Neuralink Corporation is an American neurotechnology company that
            develops implantable brain–computer interfaces (BCIs) based in
            Fremont, California. Founded by Elon Musk and a team of seven
            scientists and engineers, Neuralink was launched in 2016 and was
            first publicly reported in March 2017. The probes, composed mostly
            of polyimide, a biocompatible material, with a thin gold or platinum
            conductor, are inserted into the brain through an automated process
            performed by a surgical robot. Neuralink says they have engineered a
            surgical robot capable of rapidly inserting many flexible probes
            into the brain, which may avoid the problems of tissue damage and
            longevity issues associated with larger and more rigid probes.

          <h1>TWITTER</h1>
          <p>
            Twitter is an online social media and social networking service
            owned and operated by American company Twitter, Inc., on which users
            send and respond publicly or privately texts, images and videos
            known as "tweets".[9] Registered users can tweet, like, 'retweet'
            tweets and direct message (DM), while unregistered users only have
            the ability to view public tweets. Users interact with Twitter
            through browser or mobile frontend software, or programmatically via
            its APIs. In June 2022, Twitter announced a partnership with
            e-commerce giant Shopify, Shopify merchants. On August 23, 2022, the
            contents of a whistleblower complaint by former information security
            head Peiter Zatko to the United States Congress were published.
            Zatko had been fired by Twitter in January 2022.

          <h1>PAYPAL</h1>
          <p>
            PayPal was originally established by Max Levchin, Peter Thiel, and
            Luke Nosek in December 1998 as Confinity,a company that developed
            security software for hand-held devices. Having had no success with
            that business model, however, it switched its focus to a digital
            wallet.[10] The first version of the PayPal electronic payments
            system was launched in 1999. Shortly after PayPal's IPO, the company
            was acquired by eBay on October 3, 2002,[21] for $1.5 billion in
            eBay stock. A week after the takeover, Musk revamped Twitter Blue,
            increasing its price to $8 per month and adding new features,
            including the "blue checkmark" verification that had previously been
            reserved for high-profile confirmed users.
